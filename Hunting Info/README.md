# Hunting Info Scripts

This folder contains a couple scripts. The first is the Get-HuntingInfo. This script is a local running script that pulls a bunch of different information off the script in a sort of 'chose
your own adventure' style approach. This is not meant to be a script ran in a production network or used for a legitimate threat hunting engagement. More so just to play around with collecting 
data and helping me learn PowerShell better.

The second is the Get-AutomatedHuntingInfo script. This is meant to, eventually, be a remote running script to pull infomation off a remote system in hopes of threat hunting.
Again, not meant to be ran in production or used in legitimate engagements, but really just for me to learn how to remotely run PowerShell at a deeper level.
